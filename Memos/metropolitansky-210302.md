# Updating Filters

This memo is about updating our list of filters for the scraper. 

There were two main updates from the previous version of the filters list (which went into effect on September 19 2020 - see memo `metropolitansky-200925.md`):

1. I re-scraped the TwitterGov lists (us-house, us-senate, us-cabinet, us-cities, us-election-officials, us-presidential-candidates, and us-governors) to ensure that the accounts we’re covering are up to date since the November elections. Note that I manually removed the accounts of the two incumbent senators from Georgia who were ousted in the special election and added one of the winners, who was missing from the list. It appears that the TwitterGov list was not updated to include the Georgia election results.
2. I removed a fairly large number of accounts that I had manually added in the previous version (namely candidates for contentious House/Senate races who hadn’t been elected yet - if they did get elected then they will be covered by update 1). I also added a few accounts that I thought were important to track. See Appendix for a list of the current manually added accounts.

After these updates, the filters list now contains 2673 names, which is 11 less than the previous version. 

The updated list went into effect on March 9.
